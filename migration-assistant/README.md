# Home Assistant App: App Migration Assistant

[![Release][release-shield]][release]
![Project Stage][project-stage-shield]
![Project Maintenance][maintenance-shield]

Move an installed app to its new repository, keeping options and data.

## About

When an app moves to another repository, Home Assistant treats the new one as
a completely different app: new slug, empty configuration, empty data folder.
This app does the move for you, from a panel in the sidebar:

- Installs the new repository and the new app
- Backs up both apps before it changes anything
- Copies the configuration and the internal data folder of the old app
- Starts the new app and stops the old one from starting again

Every step checks the current state first, so a migration that failed half way
can simply be started again.

Which apps can be migrated is described by small YAML plans. Adding an app
means adding a plan, not changing code.

**Warning**: this app needs the Supervisor `admin` role and Docker access, and
only works with protection mode turned off. Uninstall it once your migration
is done.

## WARNING! THIS IS AN EDGE VERSION!

This Home Assistant Apps repository contains edge builds of apps.
Edge builds apps are based upon the latest development version.

- They may not work at all.
- They might stop working at any time.
- They could have a negative impact on your system.

This repository was created for:

- Anybody willing to test.
- Anybody interested in trying out upcoming apps or app features.
- Developers.
